# Maze-Game
This project implements a custom solution to find the shortest path through a maze using a combination of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The primary data structure used is a 2D array, where each cell corresponds to a graph node, storing its coordinates, distance from the start, and the previous node in the path. This setup ensures efficient distance lookup and updates. A Node class encapsulates these properties, facilitating easy handling. Nodes are managed using a PriorityQueue, which prioritizes nodes by their distance from the start, enabling efficient exploration. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is employed to calculate minimum distances, utilizing a 2D array initialized with infinite values except for the start node, and a PriorityQueue to determine the next node to explore. BFS complements this by ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs, making the combined approach both efficient and straightforward.
